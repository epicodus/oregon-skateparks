#Oregon Skateparks
This project is designed to create a directory of skateparks in Oregon. It allows admins or "hessians" to add new parks by city and add features to those parks, and users or "shredders" can view parks by city or feature.

The project is for the [database basics assessment](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/database-basics-assessment) for [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).
